# PyBer Ride-Sharing Analysis
## *Overview*
The executives at Pyber, a python-based ride-sharing app company, were satisfied with the initial analysis showing a breakdown fares, drivers, and rides among Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. As an additional request, the CEO, V. Isualize, has requested a visual component that clearly shows the total *weekly* fares for each of those 3 city types in order to identify how those differences might impact Pyber as a whole.
## *Results*
When looking at the outputs of our data, there's clearly a correlation between less-popuated and more densely-populated areas when it comes to the number of rides taken, the drivers hired, and the fares charged. The number of rides taken are fives times as much in Suburbabn cities than Rural cities which are in turn less than half the number of rides taken as compared to Urban cities. The number of drivers needed, therefore, follows a very similar trend. Consequently, the fares charged are about 1.5 times more expensive in Rural cities as compared to Urban cities where rides and drivers are more readily available due to the demand. Rural drivers, therefore, make almost 3.5 times as much as Urban drivers per ride. <br />

When taking all of this into account, you can see in the line graph that the total fares brought in by Rural city types are much lower week-to-week than they are in Suburban or Urban cities. While the fares there are more expensive, it's not enough to make up for the significantly smaller number of rides given overall, which makes the rides given in Urban areas the most profitable. <br />
